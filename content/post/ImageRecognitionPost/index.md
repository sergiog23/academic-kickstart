## Background 
Image captioning is the process of generating text description of images and it used NLP and Computer Vision to generate captions. For this Project I used TensorFlow tutorial, Image Captioning with visual attention. It uses an attention based model which allows us to see what parts of the image the model focuses on to generate a caption. It initially downloads an MS-COCO image dataset and preprocesses it using Inception V3 engine. It is a 13GB size file but we limit the training to 30,000 captions to speed up training.
