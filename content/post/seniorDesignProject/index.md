## Background 
In this Data Mining Project I used **Tf-idf** (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to develop my search feature on my 'iOS Mobile APP dataset' This dataset has about 7K entries and I am using the Title and Description as the textual component to search. Tf-idf is a very popular weighting scheme for scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a users query.
