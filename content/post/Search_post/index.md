## Phase I.
In this part of the project I developed a search engine using Python3, numpy,Flask, nltk, and pythonanywhere. 
I used TF-IDF to compute the score of each document in the Data.

Term frequency was calculated using how many times the term appeared in the document.

## Challenges faced:
 Some of the challenges I faced when developing Phase in was getting used to dealing with a large data set and implementing TF-IDF without using a prebuilt library. My dataset was also no the best for this project because the Youtube video description did not give very good insight on what the video was about. It had many links to Youtuber's references and information not related to the video.
