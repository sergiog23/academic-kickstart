## Background 
Running a marathon has always been something I have wanted to do. It is a bucket list item for me since I have always been into running. About less than ~1% of the world's population has run a marathon. Many people do not know the story behind the 26.2 miles. It dates back to 490 B.C. According to legend, Pheidippides ran the approximately 26 miles to announce the defeat of the Persians to some anxious Athenians. Not quite in mid-season shape, he delivered the message "Niki!" (Victory!) then keeled over and died.
